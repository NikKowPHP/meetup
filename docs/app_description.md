### **Project Title: EventFlow - The Unified City Event Platform**

### **1. Executive Summary**

EventFlow is a modern, full-stack Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to centralize and simplify event discovery within any city. It addresses the fragmented nature of finding local events by automatically aggregating happenings from various online sources into a single, intuitive, and map-based calendar. Users can discover, filter, and express interest in events directly within the app, creating a seamless experience from discovery to attendance without needing to juggle multiple websites.

### **2. The Problem**

Today's urbanite faces a time-consuming challenge when trying to find local events. Information is scattered across numerous platforms like Eventbrite, Meetup.com, Facebook Events, local blogs, and community forums. This fragmentation leads to:
*   **Missed Opportunities:** Users are often unaware of unique events happening right around them.
*   **Information Overload:** Juggling multiple tabs and apps is inefficient and frustrating.
*   **Inconsistent Experience:** Each source has a different UI and process for signing up or showing interest.

### **3. The Solution: EventFlow**

EventFlow solves this by acting as a smart, unified hub for all local events. The platform will:
1.  **Autonomously Aggregate:** Deploy a system of web scrapers to continuously discover and index events from a curated list of sources.
2.  **Centralize & Normalize:** Process and standardize the collected data into a clean, consistent format within a central database.
3.  **Provide an Intuitive Interface:** Present the events on an interactive map and a filterable calendar, allowing users to explore what's happening around them based on their location, interests, and schedule.
4.  **Simplify Engagement:** Allow users to "Join" or "Mark as Attending" directly within the app. This adds the event to their personal EventFlow calendar and serves as a simple RSVP for free events. For ticketed events, it provides a direct, seamless link to the official registration page.

### **4. Key Features**

*   **Dynamic Event Aggregation:** A robust backend service that scrapes event data (title, date, location, description, image, source URL) from various websites.
*   **Geolocation-Based Discovery:** An interactive map view that populates with events based on the user's current location or a selected area.
*   **Advanced Filtering & Search:** Users can filter events by category (e.g., Music, Tech, Art, Food), date range, price (free/paid), and keywords.
*   **Unified Event Calendar:** A personal dashboard where users can view all the events they have marked as "Attending," creating their own social calendar.
*   **One-Click Engagement:** A simple "Join" button to express interest. The system intelligently handles the distinction between internal tracking and linking out for official/paid registration.
*   **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure user accounts (via Supabase Auth) to save preferences, manage their calendar, and track attended events.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The app will be installable on mobile and desktop devices, offering offline access to saved events and the potential for push notifications for event reminders.

### **5. Technical Architecture & Stack**

This project will be built using a modern, type-safe, and highly performant technology stack, adhering to best practices for maintainability and scalability.

*   **Framework:** **Next.js**
    *   **Why:** Leveraged for its full-stack capabilities. SSR/SSG for fast initial page loads and SEO, and API Routes for creating a cohesive, monorepo-based backend.
*   **Database ORM:** **Prisma**
    *   **Why:** Ensures type-safe database queries, simplifies schema migrations, and provides an excellent developer experience, reducing common database-related errors.
*   **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** **Supabase**
    *   **Why:**
        *   **Supabase Auth:** To handle secure user registration, login (including social providers), and session management out-of-the-box.
        *   **Supabase Storage:** To host and serve event images and other user-generated content efficiently and scalably.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
    *   **Why:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid development of custom, responsive, and highly maintainable user interfaces without leaving the HTML.
*   **Frontend-Backend Communication:** **Next.js API Routes**
    *   **Why:** A RESTful or tRPC-based API will be built within the Next.js application to handle all client-server communication, ensuring a clear separation of concerns while maintaining a single codebase.

### **6. Architectural Principles & Best Practices**

The codebase will be engineered to be highly modular and maintainable from day one.
*   **Modular (Feature-Sliced) Design:** The application will be structured by feature (e.g., `/features/events`, `/features/auth`, `/features/map`), promoting high cohesion and low coupling.
*   **SOLID & DRY Principles:** Core tenets of object-oriented and functional design will be followed to create clean, understandable, and reusable code.
*   **End-to-End Type Safety:** **TypeScript** will be used across the entire stack—from the Prisma schema to the API layer and down to the React components—to catch errors at compile-time and improve code quality.
*   **Component-Based UI:** The frontend will be built with reusable React components, managed with a clear state management strategy.
*   **Environment Configuration:** Strict separation of development, staging, and production environments using `.env` files.

### **7. PWA Implementation Strategy**

To deliver a native app-like experience, EventFlow will be a fully-featured PWA.
*   **Web App Manifest:** A `manifest.json` file will allow users to "Add to Home Screen."
*   **Service Workers:** Implemented to cache key application assets and user data (like saved events), enabling offline access.
*   **Responsive Design:** The UI will be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on any device, from mobile phones to desktops.



### **8. Monetization Strategy**

Our monetization strategy is designed to be non-intrusive for the end-user while creating significant value for event organizers. The core discovery experience will remain free to maximize user adoption and build a strong community. Revenue will be generated through a multi-tiered approach, with **Stripe** serving as the secure and scalable payment infrastructure for all transactions.

#### **Primary Revenue Stream: Event Promotion for Organizers (B2B)**

The main source of revenue will be a self-service platform for event organizers to boost the visibility of their events. While all scraped and submitted events will be listed for free to ensure a comprehensive catalog, organizers can pay for premium placements.

*   **Featured Listings:** Organizers can pay a fee to have their event "Featured" on the homepage, at the top of relevant category searches, or highlighted with a unique pin on the map.
*   **Promotion Tiers:** We will offer packages based on promotion duration and reach (e.g., "City-Wide 3-Day Feature" or "Neighborhood 1-Week Boost").
*   **Implementation with Stripe:**
    *   **Stripe Checkout:** A secure, pre-built, and conversion-optimized payment page will be used for these one-time promotional purchases. This minimizes development overhead and ensures a trusted payment experience for organizers.
    *   **Stripe Webhooks:** The backend will listen for successful payment webhooks from Stripe to automatically activate the promotion on the corresponding event listing.

#### **Secondary Revenue Stream: Premium User Subscriptions (Freemium B2C)**

For power users who want an enhanced experience, we will offer an "EventFlow Pro" subscription.

*   **Free Tier:** Includes core features like browsing, searching, and adding events to the personal calendar.
*   **Pro Tier (Paid Subscription):** Unlocks advanced features such as:
    *   **Advanced Notifications:** Set up custom alerts for specific keywords, artists, or venues (e.g., "Notify me when a new jazz concert is added in my area").
    *   **Ad-Free Experience:** Remove any potential display ads from the interface.
    *   **Unlimited Calendar Sync:** Seamlessly sync their EventFlow calendar with external calendars like Google Calendar or iCal.
    *   **Curated Lists:** Access to exclusive, curated event lists (e.g., "Best Weekend Dates," "Top Free Family Events").
*   **Implementation with Stripe:**
    *   **Stripe Subscriptions:** Stripe's recurring billing engine will manage monthly and annual subscription plans, handling automated payments, retries for failed payments (dunning), and subscription lifecycle events (upgrades, downgrades, cancellations).

#### **Future Revenue Stream: Direct Ticketing Commission**

As the platform matures and gains a significant user base, we will explore integrating direct ticket sales.

*   **Integrated Ticketing:** Instead of linking out, users can purchase tickets for select events directly within the EventFlow app.
*   **Commission Model:** We will take a small percentage fee on each ticket sold through our platform.
*   **Implementation with Stripe:**
    *   **Stripe Connect:** This would allow us to operate as a platform/marketplace. We can process payments on behalf of event organizers, automatically route the majority of the funds to their account, and retain our commission fee. This is a highly scalable and compliant way to handle marketplace payments.
