# Implementation Plan: Audit Remediation

This document provides a prioritized work plan to address all findings from the SpecCheck Audit Report. The tasks are structured atomically to facilitate implementation by a developer agent, with the goal of bringing the codebase and its documentation into 100% alignment.

The audit was highly successful, indicating a codebase that is feature-complete and faithfully implemented according to its specifications. The only identified gaps were in the documentation, where new, beneficial features (User Data Deletion and a formal RBAC system) were implemented but not yet described. The following tasks will close these documentation gaps.

---

## P0 - Critical Code Fixes
*No critical code fixes were identified in the audit.*

---

## P1 - Implementation of Missing Features
*No missing features were identified in the audit.*

---

## P2 - Correcting Mismatches
*No implementation mismatches were identified in the audit.*

---

## P3 - Documentation Updates
*Tasks to modify documentation files to reflect the reality of the implemented code.*

- [x] **DOCS**: Add user story for data deletion feature.
    - **File**: `docs/app_description.md`
    - **Action**: In the "Development Epics & User Stories" section, under "Epic 3: User Onboarding & Authentication", add a new user story: `*   **EF-023: Delete Account:** As a user, I can permanently delete my account and all associated data through a settings page.`
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "Undocumented Functionality (Documentation Gaps)" for the `User Data Deletion Workflow` located in `app/settings/data/privacy.tsx` and `pages/api/user/delete.ts`.

- [x] **DOCS**: Update architectural description with the implemented RBAC model.
    - **File**: `docs/app_description.md`
    - **Action**: In section "7.2. Code Quality & Best Practices", add a new sub-section titled "**Security Model**". Describe the granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system from `lib/auth/rbac.ts`, explaining its purpose and mentioning the defined roles (`ADMIN`, `MODERATOR`, `USER`, `GUEST`).
    - **Reason**: Audit finding: "Undocumented Functionality (Documentation Gaps)" for the `Extended Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Model` found in `lib/auth/rbac.ts`.
